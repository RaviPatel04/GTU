    <p align="justify">Although discrete random variables may result from a variety of experimental situations, in
        engineering and applied science they are often associated with counting. If X is a discrete
        random variable, then Fx(x) will bave at most a countably infinite number of jumps and
        Rx = {x1,x2, .... Xk}.
