        <h2 id="ch1">Chapter 1: Introduction to web programming</h2>
        <p>
            Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes Web
            content, Web client and server scripting and network security. The most common languages used for Web
            programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript, Perl 5 and PHP. Web programming is different from just programming,
            which requires interdisciplinary knowledge on the application area, client and server scripting, and
            database technology.
            <br><br>
            Web programming can be briefly categorized into client and server coding. The client side needs programming
            related to accessing data from users and providing information. It also needs to ensure there are enough
            plug ins to enrich user experience in a graphic user interface, including security measures.
            <br><br>
            To improve user experience and related functionalities on the client side, JavaScript is usually used. It is
            an excellent client-side platform for designing and implementing Web applications.
            <br><br>
            HTML5 and CSS3 supports most of the client-side functionality provided by other application frameworks.
            <br><br>
            The server side needs programming mostly related to data retrieval, security and performance. Some of the
            tools used here include ASP, Lotus Notes, PHP, Java and MySQL. There are certain tools/platforms that aid in
            both client- and server-side programming. Some examples of these are Opa and Tersus.

        <h2 id="ch2">Chapter 2: What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is a
            combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup
            language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This
            language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and
            manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to
            define what manipulation has to be done on the text.
            <br><br>
            HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to
            display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of
            HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.
        </p>

        <h2 id="ch3">Chapter 3: What is CSS?</h2>
        <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and
            formatting of a document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is
            generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any
            kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.
            <br><br>
            CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user interfaces for web applications
            and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
        </p>
        <h2 id="ch4">Chapter 4: What is Javascript?</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language.
            It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages,
            and many non-browser environments also use it.
            <br><br>
            JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side
            developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of
            language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
            language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.
