        <h2 id="ch1">Chapter 1: Introduction to web programming</h2>
        <p>
            Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes Web
            content, Web client and server scripting and network security. The most common languages used for Web
            programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript, Perl 5 and PHP. Web programming is different from just programming,
            which requires interdisciplinary knowledge on the application area, client and server scripting, and
            database technology.

        <h2 id="ch2">Chapter 2: What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is a
            combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup
            language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This
            language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and
            manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to
            define what manipulation has to be done on the text.
        </p>

        <h2 id="ch3">Chapter 3: What is CSS?</h2>
        <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.<br>
            CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
            CSS saves a lot of work. <br>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
            External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
        </p>
        <h2 id="ch4">Chapter 4: What is Javascript?</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language.
            It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages,
            and many non-browser environments also use it.

            JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side
            developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of
            language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
            language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.
