    <p align="justify">One of the most useful discrete distributions is the Poisson distribution. The Poisson
        distribution may be developed in two ways, and both are instructive insofar as they indicate the
        circumstances where this random variable may be expected to apply in practice. The first
        development involves the definition of a Poisson process. The second development shows
        the Poisson distribution to be a limiting form of the binomial distribution.
