    <p align="justify">When dealing with two jointly distributed random variables it may be of interest to find the
        distribution Of one of these variables, given a particular value of other. That is we may wish to find
        distribution of X1 given that X2= x2. For example, what is the distribution
        of a person's weight given that he is a particular height? This prObability distribution would
        be ealled the conditional distribution of X1 given that X2 = x2.
